# Safe-Key-Capture
Safe Key Capture â€” a consent-first demo that logs keyboard events only while its Tkinter window is focused. It shows captured entries on-screen and saves timestamped key names and printable characters to `typed_log.txt`. Use only in documented, consented demos (user studies, tests, classes).
